Pre-installation Noticeâ€”Hardware and Software Environment Support
------------------------------------------------------------------

To ensure the stability and reliability of the project, we only optimize
and test for specific hardware and software environments during
development. This ensures that users deploying and running the project
on recommended system configurations will get the best performance with
the fewest compatibility issues.

By focusing resources on the mainline environment, our team can more
efficiently resolve potential bugs and develop new features.

In non-mainline environments, due to the diversity of hardware and
software configurations, as well as third-party dependency compatibility
issues, we cannot guarantee 100% project availability. Therefore, for
users who wish to use this project in non-recommended environments, we
suggest carefully reading the documentation and FAQ first. Most issues
already have corresponding solutions in the FAQ. We also encourage
community feedback to help us gradually expand support.
