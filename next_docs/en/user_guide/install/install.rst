    **Pre-installation Noticeâ€”Hardware and Software Environment Support**

    To ensure the stability and reliability of the project, we only optimize
    and test for specific hardware and software environments during
    development. This ensures that users deploying and running the project
    on recommended system configurations will get the best performance with
    the fewest compatibility issues.

    By focusing resources on the mainline environment, our team can more
    efficiently resolve potential bugs and develop new features.

    In non-mainline environments, due to the diversity of hardware and
    software configurations, as well as third-party dependency compatibility
    issues, we cannot guarantee 100% project availability. Therefore, for
    users who wish to use this project in non-recommended environments, we
    suggest carefully reading the documentation and FAQ first. Most issues
    already have corresponding solutions in the FAQ. We also encourage
    community feedback to help us gradually expand support.
